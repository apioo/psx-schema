                JSON Schema provides many ways to describe a JSON structure. The 
                price of this flexibility is that it is difficult for code generators 
                to understand a JSON Schema. This specification restricts the JSON Schema 
                keywords to a subset with a deterministic behaviour.

            <t>
                This vocabulary restricts the JSON Schema Validation keywords to a clear
                subset which removes ambiguities and inherent invalid schemas.
            </t>
            <t>
                If a JSON Schema follows these rules it is easier for processor and
                code generators to consume. This leads to better results and
                maintainability of a schema.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification should be seen as extension to the JSON Schema
                draft-wright-json-schema-validation-00 specification.
            </t>
            <t>

                        To not introduce new keywords so that all existing schema
                        processors also work with this specification.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        To build a JSON Schema standard which can also be used in 
                        the OpenAPI specification where code generation is a big concern.

                        Not to build a JSON Schema to describe every possible JSON 
                        structure. Instead to focus on the 80% use case and describe
                        these structures in a clean way.

                The specification distinguishes between three schema types: Definition,

            <t>
                The distinction is made based on the used keywords.

                <t>
                    A definition schema is a schema which describes a concrete type. 
                    It must follow the rules:

                            inside the "allOf" keyword it MUST only reference object
                            types.

        <section title="Validation">
            <t>
                JSON Schema validators are implemented in a way that they validate json data alongside 
                the data and validate this data according to the keywords which are available. So it is 
                possible to decide which validation keywords should be used depending on the actual data.
            </t>
            <t>
                If a schema follows the rules defined in this specification it can be used independently 
                of the actual data. This means that it is possible to generate i.e. a class representation 
                of the JSON Schema only based on the schema.
            </t>
            <t>
                Because of this critical design change the schema keywords must have some restrictions.
                The following section describes the behaviour of each keyword.
            </t>
            <section title="Definition keywords">

                            contain the characters "A-Z", "a-z" and "_"

                            Should be a distinct word which represents this schema,

                            since a processor could merge multiple schemas and thus
                            remove duplicate schemas.

                        The "$ref" keyword is used to reference a schema, and provides the ability to
                        validate recursive structures through self-reference.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        An object schema with a "$ref" property MUST be interpreted as a "$ref" reference.
                        The value of the "$ref" property MUST be a URI Reference.
                        Resolved against the current URI base, it identifies the URI of a schema to use.
                        All other properties in a "$ref" object MUST be ignored.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The URI is not a network locator, only an identifier. A schema need not be
                        downloadable from the address if it is a network-addressable URL, and
                        implementations SHOULD NOT assume they should perform a network operation when they
                        encounter a network-addressable URI.

                    <t>
                        A schema MUST NOT be run into an infinite loop against a schema. For example, if two
                        schemas "#alice" and "#bob" both have an "allOf" property that refers to the other,
                        a naive validator might get stuck in an infinite recursive loop trying to validate
                        the instance.
                        Schemas SHOULD NOT make use of infinite recursive nesting like this; the behavior is
                        undefined.
